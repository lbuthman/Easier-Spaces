LWC Template Types
  1. Value Templates
    - Example: customerTile
    - This type of template is foundational and doesn't have identity.
    - They are atomic, independent, and generic.
    - They represent the expression of a value, whatever that value might be.
  2. Entity Templates
    - Example: customerList
    - This type of template is composed and coordinating.
    - It is composed of value templates and other entities.
    - The highest level Entity Template resides in the UI.

- To begin understanding a process,
  1. Start with the highest level Entity Template.
  2. Understand where it is used and what it does.
  3. Identify the associated files and continue recursively until reaching the end.

- Everything in our technology has an intent and a state. [not sure if this is correct or not]
  - The state is how things are at the time of process execution.
  - The intent is the goal from the proceeding processing.
  - The Intent wraps the Process, the State sets the stage.

- A reasonable process for exhuming process maps is:
  1. Start with Lightning App Builder.
  2. Record all relevant App Pages.
  3. For each App Page, enter [To begin understand a process] process

- A reasonable process for creating a domain map is: [work in progress]
  1. Start with App Manager.
  2. Record all the Navigation Items.
    - This should provide a list of relevant Lightning App Pages.
  3. Record all the Selected Profiles

- In regards to the object model, it should quite simple.
  - Fields are only relevant to a given process.
  - If there are key fields, maybe an argument could be made to include a subset.
  - Relationships should be drawn with 1 of 2 connections.
    1. Lookup
    2. Master/Detail
  - The problems with trying to use Schema Builder for an Object Model:
    1. The fields make it unnecessarily complex.
    2. Because of long field lists, you have to zoom out pretty far to see everything.
    3. You can't save the domain map state, you have to configure it each time.
  - The good things about Schema Builder:
    1. The icons indicating that the object is part of an Unlocked Package.
    2. The detail of the fields can be interesting and helpful, that complexity is desired.
    3. It is easy to use.
    4. It is a good reality check, since it is a version of truth.
  - The good things about a custom Object Map
    1. You can add extra meaning in the arrangement.
