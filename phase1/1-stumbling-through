LWC Template Types
  1. Value Templates
    - Example: customerTile
    - This type of template is foundational and doesn't have identity.
    - They are atomic, independent, and generic.
    - They represent the expression of a value, whatever that value might be.
  2. Entity Templates
    - Example: customerList
    - This type of template is composed and coordinating.
    - It is composed of value templates and other entities.
    - The highest level Entity Template resides in the UI.

- To begin understanding a process,
  1. Start with the highest level Entity Template.
  2. Understand where it is used and what it does.
  3. Identify the associated files and continue recursively until reaching the end.

- Everything in our technology has an intent and a state. [not sure if this is correct or not]
  - The state is how things are at the time of process execution.
  - The intent is the goal from the proceeding processing.
  - The Intent wraps the Process, the State sets the stage.

- A reasonable process for exhuming process maps is:
  1. Start with Lightning App Builder.
  2. Record all relevant App Pages.
  3. For each App Page, enter [To begin understand a process] process

- A reasonable process for creating a domain map is: [work in progress]
  1. Start with App Manager.
  2. Record all the Navigation Items and dig.
  3. Record all the Selected Profiles
