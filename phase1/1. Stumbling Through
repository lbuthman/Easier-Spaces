LWC Template Types
  1. Value Templates
    - Example: customerTile
    - This type of template is foundational and doesn't have identity.
    - They are atomic, independent, and generic.
    - They represent the expression of a value, whatever that value might be.
  2. Entity Templates
    - Example: customerList
    - This type of template is composed and coordinating.
    - It is composed of value templates and other entities.
    - The highest level Entity Template resides in the UI.

- To begin understanding a process,
  1. Start with the highest level Entity Template.
  2. Understand its data, methods, and interface.
  3. Identify the associated files and continue recursively until reaching the end.
