1. How would I go about modeling this package?
  - globalValueSets -> UML Object Diagram
    - sits in the outer most domain, as it is global
  - layouts -> UI Mock
  - objects -> UML Object Diagram
    * ignoring listViews
    # this diagram is weak
      1. Salesforce can do something similar with Schema
      2. Fields without context don't mean much, except for design. But again, Schema has this already.
  - pathAssistants -> UI Mock
    # this will be more interesting once we see how the paths correlate with events/state change
  - permissionsets -> customized UML Object Diagram
  - tabs -> UI Mock with profile visibility and custom app availability

*** On second thought:
  - I don't think UI diagrams are required. They take up too much time and are too precise/definite.
  - Building UI in Salesforce is too easy, can be created and demoed quickly.
  - Instead, use simple shapes with close enough accuracy.

2. When looking from a domain perspective, how might I slice these directories up?
  - based on just this much information, I can't say.
  - after diagramming the above, move on to the next package.
