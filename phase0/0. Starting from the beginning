1. How would I go about modeling this package?
  - globalValueSets -> UML Object Diagram
    - sits in the outer most domain, as it is global
  - layouts -> UI Mock
  - objects -> UML Object Diagram
    * ignoring listViews
  - pathAssistants -> UI Mock
  - permissionsets -> customized UML Object Diagram
  - tabs -> UI Mock with profile visibility and custom app availability

2. When looking from a domain perspective, how might I slice these directories up?
  - based on just this much information, I can't say.
  - after diagramming the above, move on to the next package.
